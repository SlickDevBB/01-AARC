To do:

-   Drop down gotchi selector for players with a ton of gotchis
-   Defaul gotchi assignment with scrollable collateral types for players 
    with < 3 gotchis
-   Sort out weird sprite not loading every boot problem
-   Make the app keep trying to fetch random gotchis and don't allow battle 
    until it gets them. Refer web3/action.tsx and Home/index.tsx
-   Tidy up file pathing so don't end up with crazy relative paths
-   Sequence executing actions in a better way rather than delays and action durations
-   On hover in out etc. for player menu buttons need to be interactive with
    the circle and not the icon square
-   add seeing stars animation to players knocked out gotchis

To remember:

-   update 'games/scenes/boot-scene.ts' and 'games/main.tsx' with selected gotchis 
    from react to be able to load into phaser
